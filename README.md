## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **Firebase Auth & Firestore**
- **Hive** (local storage)
- **Provider** (state management)
- Platform support: Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd activity_tracker
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```sh
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup (Required!)

This app uses Firebase for authentication and cloud sync. You must set up your own Firebase project:

#### a. [Create a Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
#### b. Add your app (Android/iOS/Web) in the Firebase console
#### c. Download the config files:
   - **Android:** Place `google-services.json` in `android/app/`
   - **iOS:** Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`
   - **Web:** Update `web/index.html` as needed

#### d. Generate `firebase_options.dart` (REQUIRED)
This file is not included in the repo. Generate it with the [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/):

```sh
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

This will create `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your project‚Äôs Firebase config.

> **Note:** If you skip this, the app will not run! See [FlutterFire CLI docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/) for help.

### 4. Run the app
```sh
flutter run
```
